# sparse-envelope-spectrum
Test
this code is programmed for sparse envelope spectrum. if you use it
 ,please cite   "L. Liang, L. Shan, F. Liu, B. Niu, G. Xu, Sparse Envelope  Spectra
 for Feature Extraction of Bearing Faults Based on NMF[J]. Applied
 Science-basel. 2019, 9(4): 755."

the nmf code was not designed by us, you can change the function by other algorithms.

so pay attention to cite it.
Read stft_nmf.md first before you use it.
