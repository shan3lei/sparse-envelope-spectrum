# sparse-envelope-spectrum
1. Just test, please donot contact with me if any questions about details.

2. this code is programmed for sparse envelope spectrum（the details are shown in pdf）. if you use it
 ,please cite   "L. Liang, L. Shan, F. Liu, B. Niu, G. Xu, Sparse Envelope  Spectra
 for Feature Extraction of Bearing Faults Based on NMF[J]. Applied
 Science-basel. 2019, 9(4): 755."


The nmf code was not designed by us, you can change the function by other algorithms.

so pay attention to cite the algorithm if you just use the nmf in the stft_nmf file.

The decomposition of the time-frequency representation may cost most of the times, so a good decomposition algorithm is needed.

3. the nmf code was not designed by us, you can change the function by other algorithms.

so pay attention to cite the algorithm if you just use the nmf in the stft_nmf file.

4. Read stft_nmf.md first before you use it.
